### Overview

Sometimes I need to hear a song before I can play it,
especially in the rhythms department.

My current process is to input the song,
or only part of the song,
into [MuseScore](http://musescore.org/).
Those transcripts end up living here.

### Details

I do this both
for existing sheetmusic
as well as
songs I've arranged myself.

Besides the MIDIs, I also often end up with
decent looking sheetmusic
(normally rendered as PDFs).
However,
as hearing the songs is more typically the ultimate goal,
I don't put an incredible effort into creating beautiful
or totoally complete
layouts.
For example,
I often omit dynamics,
phrasing cues,
and fingering marks.

By convention,
each song has its own folder,
and somewhere I notate the arrangment's source.
